# Question

What does `element.append()` do? What is an advantage it has over `element.appendChild()`?

# Answer

`element.append()` 'closes' a given element in HTML using JS. Same with `element.appendChild()`. 

What `element.append()` has over `element.appendChild()` is that `element.append()` can append multiple tags while appendChild can only do one tag.

Yup! append allows you to append multiple nodes and strings! However, keep in mind that appendChild only allows for nodes and not strings. 

I'm not entirely sure what you mean by it 'closes' a given element tho.
