# Question

When we say "use semantic elements," what does that mean?

Please be sure to give an example of a semantic and non-semantic element in your explanation.

# Answer

Semantic elements are generally specific as to what they might do while non-semantic are more general and don't tell you anything as to what they may do.

Examples of semantic elements would be:

```js
<div>, <span>
```
Examples of non-semantic elements:

```js
<article>, <form>, <main>, <table> //etc...
```
