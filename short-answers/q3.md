# Question

Translate the following code into `async/await` please.

```js
const getAllUsers = () => {
  return fetch('https://example.com/users')
    .then(r => r.json())
    .then(users => {
      console.log('users:', users)
      return users
    })
    .catch(console.warn)
}
```

Make sure to keep all variable and function names the same. The function must behave the same way.


# Answer

```js

const getAllUsers = async () => {
  try {
    const fetchUsers = await fetch('https://example.com/users')
    const r = await res.json()
    const users = r.users
    console.log('users:', users)
    return users

  } catch (err) {
    console.warn(err)
  }
} 

```

While you were on the right track, some key points of your conversion are incorrect. 
1: Make sure all the variable names are correct
2: The original fetch never accessed r.users, so that would end up as undefined on your version.
